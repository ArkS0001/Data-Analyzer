Project id-   22_AI_2A_15
Project Name- Data Analyzer

The project is divided into 3 different versions that are using machine learning concepts with
three different interface and web application approach

Version 1.0->Uses multiple machine learning methods like random forest,k neighbours etc to predict
             viable information from the given data and for its interface,it uses an online free web app builder
             called Anvil,through which the .py,.pynb,.JSON file is connected to the webpage and an interface is 
             generated that can be accessed using a link and can run on any device with browser compatibility

Version 2.0->Uses same machine learning techniques but for web app,it uses dash.Which is a python api and is 
             used to create interactive userfriendly pages.

Version 3.0->Uses the streamlit library to generates its web app interface and it can predict heart diseases,diabetes 
             and also perform tests for covid-19

Data Analyzer is used predict Medical information for the user,can perform image recognition,can predict market prices

Procedure to run the software is to have all the required libraries and kernels installed with all the datasets present
then we just have to run the code.(You may have to edit the address of the datasets in the code before the process of cleaning)
for version 1.0 and 3.0-You just have to click on the given link to access the web application
for version 2.0-You have to install latest version of dash and flask,then run the program.
                then visit http://127.0.0.1:8050/ in your web browser.
